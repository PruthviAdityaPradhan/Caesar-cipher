Caesar Cypher to encrypt/decrypt a message

The Caesar cipher is a simple and well-known encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, 
who reportedly used it to communicate securely with his generals. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. 
For example, with a shift of 3, the letter 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. The Caesar cipher is easy to implement but also easy to break, especially with modern computational techniques, 
making it a basic introduction to the concept of encryption and cryptography.
